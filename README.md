# Energy Customer Churn Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling of customer churn for an energy provider. The goal is to identify key factors influencing churn and develop a machine learning model to predict high-risk customers.

## Overview

The analysis explores factors that contribute to customer churn, including:
- Consumption patterns
- Sales channels
- Price sensitivity
- Customer tenure

## Key Findings

Overall churn rate: ~9.7%

Primary churn drivers:

Net margin on power subscriptions is the strongest predictor of churn.

Consumption levels and contract duration significantly influence customer retention.

Price sensitivity was found to be less impactful than initially expected.

Churn varies across sales channels, highlighting potential strategic improvements.


## Predictive Model
A machine learning model was developed to predict customer churn, achieving the following evaluation metrics:

Accuracy: 90.36%

Precision: 81.82%

Recall: 4.92%

This model helps identify at-risk customers early, allowing for targeted retention strategies.
## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

  ##Next Steps
Implement an early warning system based on model predictions.

Develop tailored retention strategies for high-risk customers.

Continuously refine the model as new data becomes available.
